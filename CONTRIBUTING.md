## Code

If you want to contribute to the codebase of EOTDL, first fork this repository and clone your fork to your machine.

Then, create a new branch and implement your work, which should include testing if necessary.

Finally, create a Pull Request to the `develop` branch so we can review it and merge it.

To run the api:

```
docker-compose up
```

The first time you run it you have to initialize the database calling the `/admin/init-db` endpoint using the admin api key provided in the docker-compose file. This will create the `tiers` and `tags` collections required for the API to work.

To run the cli:

```
export EOTDL_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 # or the url of the api
python eotdl/main.py --help #Â or any other command
```

To run the tests:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up

# run the API tests
docker exec eotdl-api-test pytest api/tests
```
