## Events

To add an event to the website, you have to edit the [`ui/src/routes/events.json`](ui/src/routes/events.json) file (click on the previous link to open it).

The event has to be a JSON object with the following properties:

- **title**: the title of the event
- **description**: the description of the event
- **date**: the date of the event
- **dateTo** (optional): the end date of the event if it's an event that lasts more than one day
- **link**: the link to the event

You can copy and paste the following template to create the event:

```json
{
  "title": "Event Title",
  "description": "Event Description",
  "date": "Event Date in the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY (for example, 2024-04-02)",
  "dateTo": "End date (optional) in the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY (for example, 2024-04-04)",
  "link": "Event Link"
}
```

Once the file is edited, click on "Commit changes" (green button) and select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request". Then, click on "Propose changes" and then "Create pull request". You can add some description in the process (optional). Preferably, make the pull request against the `develop` branch.

Once we review, we will merge it and the event will be added to the website.

## Posts

To add a post to the website, you can create a new `mardkown` file in [`ui/src/routes/blog`](ui/src/routes/blog). The post should be a markdown file with the following structure:

```
---
title: Post title
date: Post date
description: Post description
tags: Post tags
link: Link to the post on Github (or the notebook if it's a tutorial)
---

# A title

some content

```

The first part (between the `---` lines) is the metadata of the post and the second part is the actual content of the post in [markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). We recommend you use a markdown editor to write the post and then copy the content into the file.

Once the file is edited, click on "Commit changes" (green button) and select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request". Then, click on "Propose changes" and then "Create pull request". You can add some description in the process (optional). Preferably, make the pull request against the `develop` branch.

Once we review, we will merge it and the event will be added to the website.

## Datasets

If you would like us to include a new dataset, create an issue with the following information and we'll add it to the list.

- **Name**: dataset name
- **Size**: dataset size in Gigaytes
- **Source**: data source (i.e Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, Drone, ...)
- **Technique**: AI technique that can be solved with the dataset (i.e classification, object detection, ...)
- **Application**: the application enabled by the dataset (i.e land cover, urban development, ...)
- **AOI**: geographical extension of the dataset
- **Time Span**: temporal extension of the dataset
- **License**: the license of the dataset
- **Download link**: the link to download the dataset
- **References**: links to references (i.e papers, blog posts, repos, ...)

And any other relevant information.

## Code

If you want to contribute to the codebase of EOTDL, first fork this repository and clone your fork to your machine.

Then, create a new branch and implement your work, which should include testing if necessary.

Finally, create a Pull Request to the `develop` branch so we can review it and merge it.

To run the api:

```
docker-compose up
```

The first time you run it you have to initialize the database calling the `/admin/init-db` endpoint using the admin api key provided in the docker-compose file. This will create the `tiers` and `tags` collections required for the API to work.

```
curl localhost:8010/admin/init-db -H 'X-API-Key: 12345678' # or the url/api key of the api
```

To run the cli:

```
export EOTDL_API_URL=http://localhost:8010 # or the url of the api
python eotdl/main.py --help #Â or any other command
```

To run the tests:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up

# run the API tests
docker exec eotdl-api-test pytest api/tests
```
