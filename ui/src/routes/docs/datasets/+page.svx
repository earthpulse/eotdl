# Datasets

The main feature that EOTDL offers is a repository of Training Datasets (TDS). Feel free to explore available datasets and download them for 
training your ML models.

EOTDL also offers tools to create new datasets, or improve existing ones, including data access functionality, data curation and engineering tools such as labelling and feature engineering.
