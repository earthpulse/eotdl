# Creating new datasets

EOTDL offers the following functionality for creating datasets:

- Explore and stage available satellite imagery
- Generate STAC metadata for your dataset

You can combine the tools offered on EOTDL with your own to create a dataset. 

We also encourage you to contribute to the EOTDL project by adding your own tools to the platform so that others can use them to create datasets.
