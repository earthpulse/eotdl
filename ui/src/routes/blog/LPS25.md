# Join us at the Living Planet Symposium 2025 üåç

The [Living Planet Symposium](https://lps25.esa.int/) is a major event in the Earth Observation community, bringing together researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers to discuss the latest developments in the field. In this year's edition, taking place in Vienna on June 23-27, EOTDL will be present with the following activities:

## üéì Tutorial session

On Sunday June 22, we will be hosting a tutorial session on Room 1.31/1.32 from 15:30 to 16:50. Join us if you want to have a hands-on experience with EOTDL.

In this tutorial session, participants will dive deep into the world of machine learning in Earth observation. Designed for both beginners and seasoned practitioners, this tutorial will guide you through the comprehensive workflow of using the Earth Observation Training Data Lab (EOTDL) to build, manage, and deploy high-quality training datasets and machine learning models. Throughout the session, you will begin with an introduction to the fundamentals of EOTDL, exploring its datasets, models, and the different accesibility layers. We will then move into a detailed walkthrough of EOTDL‚Äôs capabilities, where you‚Äôll learn how to efficiently ingest raw satellite data and transform it into structured, usable datasets. Emphasis will be placed on practical techniques for data curation, including the utilization of STAC metadata standards, ensuring your datasets are both discoverable and interoperable. Next, the session will focus on model development, showcasing the process of training and validating machine learning models using curated datasets, including feature engineering. Real-world examples and case studies will be presented to illustrate how EOTDL can be leveraged to solve complex problems in fields such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. By the end of the tutorial, you will have gained valuable insights into the complete data pipeline‚Äîfrom dataset creation to model deployment‚Äîand the skills necessary to apply these techniques in your own projects.

## üë• Meet the developers

On Tuesday June 24, we will be hosting a meet the developers session in Area 2 from 17:30 to 18:30. 

During this session, the EOTDL core team will be available to answer any questions you may have about the project. If you have any specific topic you would like to discuss, please [contact us](mailto:juan@earthpulse.ai) in advance so we can schedule a slot during the session.

## üìä Poster

Finally, on Thursday June 26, we will be presenting our poster in the Poster area.
