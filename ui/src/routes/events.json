On behalf of the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC), I am deeply honored to usher you into a week of exploration, collaboration, and inspiration.
  The theme of our conference, “Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing for a Better Tomorrow”, resonates profoundly with our collective mission. These are not just scientific domains but tools of transformation, enabling us to see our world from new perspectives, to make informed decisions, and to chart a course for a sustainable and inclusive future. By harnessing the precision of photogrammetry, the insights from remote sensing, and the encompassing knowledge of spatial sciences, we hold the keys to understanding our planet’s past, navigating its present, and shaping its future.",
