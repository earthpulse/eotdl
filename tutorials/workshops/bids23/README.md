# Create your own dataset

Welcome to the workshop! In this hands-on tutorial, developed by [EarthPulse](https://earthpulse.ai/) for the [BiDS 23](https://www.bigdatafromspace2023.org/), we are going to explore and unleash the capabilities of the [Earth Observation Training Data Lab](https://www.eotdl.com/) (EOTDL) environment. 

In this workshop, we will learn how to use the EO-TDL open source tools to create our very own dataset for Earth Observation Machine Learning applications. This tutorial aims to cover the end-to-end process of creating a usable dataset, from creating and sharing the dataset to training and deploying a ready-to-use AI model.

Let's get started! Go to the `00_exploration` notebook and start the tutorial!
