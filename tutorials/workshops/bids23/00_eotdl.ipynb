    "One of the most limiting factors of AI for EO applications is the scarcity of suitable and accessible **Training Datasets** (TDS). As the name suggests, TDS are used to train an AI model to perform a specific task. Currently, the main barrier is that gathering and labelling EO data is a convoluted process. Some techniques exist that can help alleviate this issue, for example transfer learning or unsupervised learning, but annotated data is always required for fine-tuning and final validation of AI models.\n",
    " \n",
    "Generating TDS is time consuming and expensive. Data access is usually limited and costly, especially for Very High Resolution (VHR) images that allow objects like trees to be clearly identified. In some cases, domain experts or even in-person (in-situ) trips are required to manually confirm the objects in a satellite image are correctly annotated with a high degree of quality. This results in the field of AI for EO applications lagging when compared to other fields, impeding the development of new applications and limiting the full potential of AI in EO."
