    "1. Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/hYxc5AJB92) server and request the `devleoper` status. This will grant you access to the private channels where we discuss the development of EOTDL.\n",

    "4. Once you have finished the feature, create a pull request to the `develop` branch of the main repository.\n",
