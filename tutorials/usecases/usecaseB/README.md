# Use Case B - Flood Detection (Data Fusion)

In this use case we are going to develop a Data Fusion dataset for flood detection consisting of S1-S2-DEM triplets with manually labelled water masks for flooding detection. This dataset will be built upon the already existing SEN12-FLOOD dataset64, which will be improved with DEM data and additional samples for recent floods and new geographical areas (mainly Europe and Asia). Active Learning will be used to assist in the process of creation of the dataset, training a model on the original SEN12-FLOOD65 dataset to provide labels on the new images which will be then validated manually. The process will be repeated several times until the desired quality metrics are achieved. The main platform tools that will be tested are: Improve an existing dataset with DEM data for the existing AOIs, improve an existing dataset with additional data for new AOIs, defining geographically constrained AOIs and massively download S1, S2 and DEM imagery, training a model in the cloud with the datasets, use the model to suggest new labels (Active Learning).
