# Use Case E - Water quality in sediment loaded waters

In this use case we show how to use an EOTDL dataset and EOTDL functionality to concur a training of neural networks that can be integrated into the SNAP C2RCC processor.

The Use Case functionality is documented and implemented within the Jupyter Notebook 'Training_Custom_Neural_Networks_for_SNAP_C2RCC.ipynb'.
